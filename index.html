                Mary Rose is a digital story crafted into an electronic
                literature piece by Natasha Nunn, initially intended to be a
                novel. This work emerged from a Digital Fictions class project
                in 2019, and it's a narrative about Nunn’s children’s
                great-grandmother, evolving from a family tale into an
                interactive digital experience (Nunn, 2019). As a piece of
                e-lit, it allows readers to engage physically with the story
                through scrolling and clicking.

                The interactivity in Mary Rose is both intuitive and essential.
                The text is enveloped in fog-like graphics, with arrows guiding
                the reader to scroll down. This act reveals more of the story
                and invites readers to interact with dots that, when clicked,
                display new images and narratives. These dots are crucial in
                determining how the story unfolds for the reader, although there
                only is one “ending”. In conclusion, a choice between two
                options - “Am I still needed / or is it time to go?” - affects
                the visual representation of the ending, one shrouded in black,
                the other submerged underwater, shows they can choose what they
                want, but it all leads to the end.

                Defining Mary Rose in terms of genre, it fits comfortably within
                the definitions of interactive fiction and digital storytelling.
                It could also be described as a digital dramatised memoir,
                considering its story based on personal history, combining
                factual and fictional elements. The narrative carries ghost
                story features, focusing on memories and the past.

                Nonlinearity is a prominent aspect of the experience. The
                reader’s journey through the story differs by the sequence in
                which they interact with the dots, introducing a non-prescribed
                path through the narrative. This format suggests elements of
                aleatory processes, where the reader's actions - clicking and
                scrolling - introduce a sense of randomness to the unfolding of
                the tale.

                Our analysis incorporates the distinctive use of clouds that is
                used as background and frame in Mary Rose, which we felt were
                central visuals to the story. We reflected on this technique in
                our work, building on its simplicity and thematic impact. Our
                version borrows the process of uncovering hidden thoughts or
                memories, a nod to Mary Roses’ design by having text hide behind
                these clouds and only shown through interacting. Mary Rose has a
                rather muted colour palette, we wanted our presentation to be
                more vibrant. In conclusion, Mary Rose is an exemplary work of
                e-lit, using digitality to add depth through visuals, immersion
                and interactivity to a story that could have been a traditional
                novel. Mary Rose exemplifies how a story can be enhanced and get
                a new and deeper meaning through digital elements.
